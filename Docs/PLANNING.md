# Planning

The first part of creating a tiny ground station is figuring out if you have clear line of site to the satellite. Pick a few locations to place a tripod ([Hardware BOM](/Docs/SAT_HARDWARE_BOM.md)) and get a rough order of magnitude for whether you can run power to the location and point to the satellite. For the GOES weather satellite, this means the satellite is to the south (if you live in the northern hemisphere) and to the north (if you live in the southern hemisphere). 

Criteria for site location:

1. Clear line of site to the satellite.
2. Ability to run power (extension cord can reach).
3. Safety first (no one will trip or get hit by the small dish).

Tools to figure out where you need point, use the following tools:

1. Dishpointer
2. Pointing app like look4sat

# Dishpointer

The dishpointer app (<https://www.dishpointer.com>)has long been used by satellite planners to understand where to point an asset. In this case, using Florida International University, we can see that the satellite GOES-16 has to be pointed at an elevation of 59.3 and an azimuth of 168.2

Depending on your location, the view to the satellite can be obstructed by natural or man made objects. If so, you may be to adjust your location accordingly. In the real world, such "site surveys" happen all the time. There are various tools available to help determine if blockage is a concern.

## Lightning Protection & Grounding (optional)

Lightning protection and proper grounding are important. In this tutorial, the reccomendation is that you only use the ground station during clear sky conditions. Store it during other times. The portability of the kit to take to schools is a benefit of the tripod setup. However, for permanent installations, check with your local rules and/or facilities manager for proper grounding techniques. 

The ARRL has a nice description on grounding that can be found at: <http://www.arrl.org/grounding>

In a home installation, typical options include SMA lightning arrestors and grounding to a rod located at least 15 feet from the home. This is typical with setups for satellite TV such as "DirecTV."

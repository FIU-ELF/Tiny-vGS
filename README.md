To do this, you'll acquire a ground station kit, use open source software to download an image and use the cloud to visualize system performance. You'll work through the steps to install & virtualize your setup:

1. Plan your installation
2. Plan your BOM & acquire hardware
3. Assemble and install your setup
4. Point your dish
5. Acquire your first image
6. Design a cloud solution
7. Infrastructure as Code
8. Microservices
9. Operations Support Systems
10. Business Support systems
11. Content Delivery Network

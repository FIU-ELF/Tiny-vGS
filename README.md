# Tiny-vGS

Tiny virtual Ground Station (vGS) is a Raspberry Pi based Ground Station meant to get students involved in the intersection of space and ground station virtualization.

# Mission 

Acquire images from a geostationary satellite ([GOES](/Docs/GOES.md)) using a backyard Ground Station setup. To do this, you'll acquire a ground station kit, use open source software to download an image and use the cloud to visualize system performance. You'll work through the steps to install & virtualize your setup:

1. Plan your installation- Plan your installation by performing a site survey: [Plan your installation](/Docs/PLANNING.md)
3. Plan your BOM & acquire hardware- Use a base BOM, add specific needs for your use case and acquire hardware: [Hardware BOM](/Docs/SAT_HARDWARE_BOM.md)
4. Assemble and install your setup- Let's assemble the kit and install the setup: [Installing the hardware](/Docs/INSTALL.md)
5. Setup your edge device- Create an edge appliance that allows you to run virtualized radio functions: [Setup your edge](/Docs/EDGE.md)
6. Virtualized Radio Functions & Infrastructure as Code- Learn about virtualized radio functions and infrastructure as code: [vRF and IAC](/Docs/VNF_IAC.md)
7. Point your dish & acquire your first image- You are ready to point your dish! Let's try to get an image: [Point your dish](/Docs/POINTING.md)
8. Design and performs trades on a cloud solution- Perform trade studies on how to create value added capability with the cloud: [The Cloud](/Docs/CLOUD.md)
9. Microservices- Write microservices to expose metrics to your operations suspport systems: [Microservices](/Docs/MICRO.md)
10. Operations Support Systems- Implement Operations Support Systems: [OSS](/Docs/OSS.md)
11. Business Support systems- Use cloud Business Support Systems to understand billing: [BSS](/Docs/BSS.md)
12. Content Delivery Network- Create a Contend Delivery application for your images: [CDN](/Docs/CDN.md)
